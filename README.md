# How to install and run the mod

1. Steps to come...

# Contributing to the mod

1. Fork and then download the repository.

2. Install WINSE's PBO Manager, <a href="https://github.com/winseros/PBOManager" target="_blank">https://github.com/winseros/PBOManager</a>

3. Install GitKraken, <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/" target="_blank">https://www.gitkraken.com</a>

4. Make the changes that you want, look at the rest of the mod to get a sense of the style guide, i.e splitting the categories up.

5. To load the mod for tests it must be done locally, create folder called `@Myr-Mod` and inside that make an `addons` folder where you will store compiled pbos (generated by bat or PBO Manager)

    Keep in mind that the buildpbo.bat file can replace the pbo in the `addons` folder for your local mod `@Myr-Mod`to make it easy for you.

6. Open Arma, make sure to load the latest, base mod list while testing, and select "Add Local Mod" in the mods tab of the launcher and select the `@Myr-Mod` folder that you will need to make and store the compiled pbo within.

7. Make sure to **unload** the official Workshop version of the mod and start the game.

8. Now test your added feature, make sure no errors related to your change appear, and that the intended functionality occurs.

9. Now simply commit and push your changes to your git fork, and submit a merge request, I'll look over your changes and either make suggestions or merge your request.

10. Thanks for your contribution!
